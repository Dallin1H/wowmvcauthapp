# MVC Project With Authentication
A quick project I made using an MVC architectural style with user authentication using Passport.js in node.

## How It's Made:
Tech used: EJS, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB

I first built this simple API to perform basic CRUD operations, then I rebuilt it to fit an MVC architectural style, and finally I added authentication using Passport.js and other middleware. 

## What I Learned:
I got more practice and became even more familiar with building apps using a model-view-controller architecture. I also worked with Passport.js for the first time to add proper user authentication.
